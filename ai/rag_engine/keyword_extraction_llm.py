"""
LLM-Based Keyword Extraction Module

Uses LLM to robustly extract keywords for citation filtering.
Handles edge cases automatically: short terms, multi-word phrases, negation, synonyms.

Advantages over rule-based extraction:
- Context-aware (understands "fuel economy" as a phrase)
- Expands synonyms ("mileage" for "fuel economy")
- Detects sentiment ("issues" → negative filter)
- No maintenance (adapts to new car models/terms automatically)

    prompt = f"""You are an automotive keyword extraction specialist. Extract keywords from user queries for filtering automotive discussion data.

**YOUR TASK:**
Extract the MOST SPECIFIC keywords for filtering automotive conversations (forum posts, WhatsApp messages). Focus on PRECISION - only extract keywords that meaningfully narrow down the search.

**CRITICAL RULES:**

1. **Multi-Word Phrases**: Keep common phrases together (don't split)
   - "fuel economy" → Keep as ONE keyword: "fuel economy"
   - "brake fluid" → Keep as ONE keyword: "brake fluid"
   - "engine oil" → Keep as ONE keyword: "engine oil"
   - "after sales service" → Keep as ONE phrase if it's about a SPECIFIC after-sales issue

2. **Short Technical Terms**: ALWAYS include automotive abbreviations (even if ≤3 chars)
   - Transmissions: DCT, CVT, AMT, AT, MT
   - Drivetrain: AWD, 4WD, 2WD, FWD, RWD
   - Safety: ABS, ESP, EBD, TCS, ESC
   - Tech: AC, GPS, USB, LED, HID, DRL
   - Fuel: LPG, CNG, HEV, PHEV, ICE
   - Models: H6, H9, Rio (single/short model names)
   - Other: RPM, KMH, BHP, PSI, NVH

3. **ALWAYS SKIP - Too Generic / Broad**:

   a) **Question Words & Quantifiers**:
      - what, which, where, when, how, why, who
      - most, top, all, some, any, many, few
      - first, last, main, major, best, worst

   b) **Reference Words**:
      - customer, customers, user, users, owner, owners
      - chat, chats, conversation, message, messages
      - post, posts, thread, comment, feedback, review

   c) **Generic Automotive Terms** (too broad - matches EVERYTHING):
      - car, cars, vehicle, vehicles, model, models
      - auto, automobile, motor

   d) **Brand Names** (ALWAYS SKIP unless part of specific model):
      - Haval, Kia, Toyota, Honda, Suzuki, Nissan, Mazda, Hyundai, Ford, Chevrolet
      - MG, Changan, Proton, Geely, BYD, Cherry
      - **Exception**: Keep if it's a model name itself (e.g., "Sportage", "Corolla")

      **Brand Name Rules**:
      - "Haval H6" → Keep "H6" ONLY (skip "Haval")
      - "Kia Sportage" → Keep "Sportage" ONLY (skip "Kia")
      - "Toyota Camry" → Keep "Camry" ONLY (skip "Toyota")
      - "Haval battery issues" → Keep "battery" ONLY (skip "Haval")

   e) **Generic Service Terms** (too broad unless part of specific issue):
      - after sales, aftersales, after-sales (unless "after sales SERVICE issue")
      - service, service center, dealership, dealer
      - company, manufacturer, brand
      - **Exception**: Keep if combined with specific issue like "after sales delay" or "service center closed"

   f) **Generic Problem Words** (extract as SENTIMENT instead):
      - issue, issues, problem, problems
      - complaint, complaints, concern, concerns
      - These become sentiment_filter: "negative", NOT keywords

4. **Sentiment Detection** (problem/praise words → sentiment filter, NOT keywords):

   **NEGATIVE Sentiment Signals**:
   - issue, issues, problem, problems, fault, faults
   - complaint, complaints, defect, defects, failure, failures
   - broken, damaged, faulty, error, errors, bug, bugs
   → Set sentiment_filter: "negative"

   **POSITIVE Sentiment Signals**:
   - praise, excellent, great, amazing, awesome, fantastic
   - love, loved, satisfied, happy, pleased
   - best, perfect, flawless, outstanding
   → Set sentiment_filter: "positive"

   **Otherwise**: sentiment_filter: null

5. **Negation Handling** (reverse logic):
   - "NOT battery issues" → SKIP "battery" (negated keyword)
   - "without problems" → sentiment_filter: "positive" (absence of problems = positive)
   - "no complaints" → sentiment_filter: "positive" (inverted)
   - "cars that DON'T have X" → SKIP X, sentiment_filter: "positive"

6. **Synonym Expansion** (ONLY if include_synonyms=True):
   - Use underscores for multi-word synonyms (matches enrichment tags format)
   - Max 4-5 most relevant automotive-specific synonyms

   **Examples**:
   - "fuel economy" → ["mileage", "fuel_average", "consumption", "kmpl"]
   - "battery" → ["battery_drain", "battery_life", "battery_health", "battery_failure"]
   - "brake" → ["braking", "brake_pad", "brake_fluid", "brake_disc", "brake_noise"]
   - "AC" → ["air_conditioning", "cooling", "climate_control", "AC_compressor"]
   - "engine" → ["engine_noise", "engine_vibration", "engine_performance", "engine_oil"]

   **Synonym Quality Rules**:
   - Use underscores (battery_drain, not "battery drain") to match tag format
   - Only include SPECIFIC automotive terms, not generic words
   - Prefer technical terms over colloquial ones

**OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):**
{{
  "keywords": ["keyword1", "multi word phrase", "H6"],
  "sentiment_filter": "negative" | "positive" | null,
  "synonyms": ["synonym1", "synonym2"] | []
}}

**EXAMPLES:**

Example 1 - Short technical terms + brand filtering:
Query: "DCT transmission problems in Haval H6"
Output:
{{
  "keywords": ["DCT", "transmission", "H6"],
  "sentiment_filter": "negative",
  "synonyms": ["dual_clutch", "gearbox", "gear_shift", "transmission_fluid"]
}}
Note: "Haval" SKIPPED (brand name), "H6" KEPT (specific model), "problems" → sentiment

Example 2 - Multi-word phrase preservation:
Query: "fuel economy"
Output:
{{
  "keywords": ["fuel economy"],
  "sentiment_filter": null,
  "synonyms": ["mileage", "fuel_average", "consumption", "kmpl"]
}}

Example 3 - Problem words → sentiment filter:
Query: "brake issues"
Output:
{{
  "keywords": ["brake"],
  "sentiment_filter": "negative",
  "synonyms": ["braking", "brake_pad", "brake_fluid", "brake_disc", "brake_noise"]
}}
Note: "issues" → sentiment_filter, NOT a keyword

Example 4 - Generic terms filtered:
Query: "What are the most top customer complaints about battery from after sales?"
Output:
{{
  "keywords": ["battery"],
  "sentiment_filter": "negative",
  "synonyms": ["battery_drain", "battery_life", "battery_health", "battery_failure"]
}}
Note: SKIPPED: "what", "most", "top", "customer", "complaints" (sentiment), "after sales" (too generic)

Example 5 - Negation handling:
Query: "Cars WITHOUT battery issues"
Output:
{{
  "keywords": [],
  "sentiment_filter": "positive",
  "synonyms": []
}}
Note: "battery" SKIPPED (negated by "WITHOUT"), "issues" → positive sentiment (inverted)

Example 6 - Positive sentiment:
Query: "Show me positive reviews about AC performance"
Output:
{{
  "keywords": ["AC", "performance"],
  "sentiment_filter": "positive",
  "synonyms": ["air_conditioning", "cooling", "climate_control", "AC_compressor"]
}}

Example 7 - Brand + specific issue (your exact query):
Query: "what are the most top complains about battery issues from haval after sales?"
Output:
{{
  "keywords": ["battery"],
  "sentiment_filter": "negative",
  "synonyms": ["battery_drain", "battery_life", "battery_health", "battery_failure"]
}}
Note: SKIPPED: "what", "most", "top", "complains" (sentiment), "haval" (brand), "after sales" (generic service term)
Note: KEPT: "battery" (specific component)
Note: "issues" + "complains" → sentiment_filter: "negative"
