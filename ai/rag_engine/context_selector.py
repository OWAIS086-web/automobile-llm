"""
Dynamic Contextual Anchoring - LLM-Based Context Selection

Intelligently selects which chat messages are relevant for the current query.
Replaces the fixed 4-message window with intent-aware selection.

Advantages:
- Saves tokens by only using relevant messages
- Handles "summarize above" (last message only)
- Handles "compare to earlier" (search full history)
- Detects topic switches (ignore previous context)

**YOUR TASK**: Analyze the user's current query and determine which messages from the chat history are needed to understand it.

**CHAT HISTORY** (most recent {len(recent_history)} messages):
{history_text}

**CURRENT USER QUERY**: "{query}"

**CONTEXT TYPES**:

1. **META_OP** (Meta-operation on previous answer):
   - User wants to TRANSFORM/OPERATE ON the previous assistant response
   - Trigger words: "summarize above", "elaborate", "explain more", "clarify that", "expand on this"
   - Selection: **ONLY the last assistant message** (the answer they want to transform)
   - Example: "summarize above in 100 words" → Use only last assistant message

2. **DATA_REQUEST** (Request for new data with context):
   - User is asking for NEW information but references previous context
   - Trigger words: "what about X?", "show me Y", "compare X and Y"
   - Selection: **Last 1-3 messages** to understand topic/entities being discussed
   - Example: "what about Ahmed?" → Use last 2 messages to understand what topic Ahmed is related to

3. **CLARIFICATION** (Asking to clarify or compare with earlier discussion):
   - User references something discussed EARLIER in the conversation (not just previous message)
   - Trigger words: "like you said earlier", "compared to before", "you mentioned previously"
   - Selection: **Specific messages** mentioned + last message for current context
   - Example: "compare to what you said about pricing" → Find pricing message + last message

4. **TOPIC_SWITCH** (Completely new topic):
   - User is switching to a completely different topic, no relation to previous discussion
   - Trigger words: "now show me...", "switching topics...", completely unrelated query
   - Selection: **NONE** (no context needed, this is a fresh query)
   - Example: After discussing pricing, user asks "show me delivery complaints" → No context needed

5. **NEW_TOPIC** (First query or standalone):
   - First message in conversation OR query is fully standalone
   - Selection: **NONE**
   - Example: "What are the top complaints?" (first query in session)

**CRITICAL RULES**:

1. **Minimize Context**: ONLY select messages that are DIRECTLY relevant. More context = wasted tokens.

2. **Meta-Operations**: If user says "summarize above", "elaborate", "explain more" → They want to operate on the LAST ANSWER ONLY. Do NOT include more messages.

3. **Topic Switches**: If user switches topic (e.g., from pricing to delivery), do NOT include previous messages. Mark as TOPIC_SWITCH.

4. **Pronouns**: If user says "what about it?", "show me that", "and him?" → Need last 1-2 messages to resolve pronouns.

5. **Relative References**: "above", "previously", "earlier", "that", "this" → Determine if referring to last message or earlier messages.

**OUTPUT FORMAT** (JSON only, no explanation):

    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why these messages were selected (1 sentence)",

**EXAMPLES**:
