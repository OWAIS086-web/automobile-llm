"""
Format Instruction Detection Module

Uses LLM to detect if user has given specific format instructions
in their query (e.g., "summarize in 200 words", "give bullet points").

    """
    Use LLM to detect if user has given specific format instructions.

    This is a PRODUCTION approach that handles ANY format the user might request,
    without hardcoding keywords.

    Args:
        query: User's query
        llm: LLM client for detection (should be fast, like Grok-3-fast)

    Returns:
        Format instruction string if detected (e.g., "in 200 words"), None otherwise

    Examples:
        Input: "Summarize this in 200 words please"
        Output: "in 200 words"

        Input: "Give me bullet points about Haval issues"
        Output: "as bullet points"

        Input: "What are the top problems?"
        Output: None (no format instruction)

    Cost: ~$0.0001 (Grok-3-fast, ~50 tokens)
    Latency: ~0.1s

    detection_prompt = f"""Analyze this user query to detect if they have given a SPECIFIC FORMAT INSTRUCTION for how they want the response.

**USER QUERY**: "{query}"

**YOUR TASK**:
Determine if the user has explicitly requested a specific format, structure, length, or style for the answer.

**FORMAT TYPES TO DETECT**:

1. **Word/Character Count**:
   - "in 200 words", "in 150 words", "500 word summary"
   - "in 2 paragraphs", "in 3 sentences"
   - "keep it under 100 words", "maximum 250 words"

2. **List Structures**:
   - "as bullet points", "give me bullets", "bullet form"
   - "numbered list", "as a list", "list format"
   - "in point form", "key points only"

3. **Table/Visual Formats**:
   - "in table format", "as a table", "create a table"
   - "in a spreadsheet format", "tabular form"
   - "comparison table", "side by side"

4. **Document Types**:
   - "as a report", "write a report", "formal report"
   - "as an essay", "essay format"
   - "as a memo", "memo format"
   - "executive summary", "brief summary"

5. **Paragraph Styles**:
   - "in paragraph form", "as paragraphs"
   - "detailed explanation", "elaborate", "in detail"
   - "brief overview", "quick summary", "concise"
   - "step by step", "sequential format"

6. **Tone/Style Modifiers**:
   - "in simple language", "explain like I'm 5"
   - "technical terms", "professional language"
   - "conversational tone", "casual style"

7. **Specific Structures**:
   - "pros and cons", "advantages and disadvantages"
   - "Q&A format", "question and answer"
   - "timeline format", "chronological order"
   - "grouped by category", "categorize"

8. **Comparison Formats**:
   - "compare and contrast", "side by side comparison"
   - "before and after", "old vs new"

9. **Length Indicators**:
   - "briefly", "in brief", "short answer"
   - "comprehensively", "exhaustively", "in depth"
   - "one line", "one sentence"

**EXAMPLES** (Learn the pattern):

✅ Query: "Summarize this in 200 words please"
   Response: "in 200 words"

✅ Query: "Give me bullet points about Haval issues"
   Response: "as bullet points"

✅ Query: "Create a detailed report about complaints"
   Response: "as a detailed report"

✅ Query: "List the top 10 problems in table format"
   Response: "in table format with top 10 problems"

✅ Query: "Explain H6 features briefly in 3 paragraphs"
   Response: "briefly in 3 paragraphs"

✅ Query: "Compare Haval and Kia side by side"
   Response: "side by side comparison"

✅ Query: "Give me a quick summary under 100 words"
   Response: "quick summary under 100 words"

✅ Query: "Write this as a professional memo to management"
   Response: "as a professional memo"

✅ Query: "Break this down step by step for my team"
   Response: "step by step breakdown"

✅ Query: "Categorize the complaints by severity in a numbered list"
   Response: "categorized by severity in numbered list"

❌ Query: "What are the top 10 problems?"
   Response: None (asking for top 10 is CONTENT, not FORMAT)

❌ Query: "Explain H6 features"
   Response: None (no format instruction)

❌ Query: "Tell me about brake issues"
   Response: None (no format specified)

❌ Query: "Summarize"
   Response: None (too vague, no specific format)

**CRITICAL RULES**:
1. Only detect EXPLICIT format instructions (user directly states HOW they want it formatted)
2. Do NOT detect CONTENT requests (what they want to know about)
   - "top 10 problems" = content (WHAT), not format (HOW)
   - "in bullet points" = format (HOW)
3. Combine multiple format hints if present:
   - "Give me 5 bullet points about X" → "5 bullet points"
   - "Write a brief 200-word report" → "brief 200-word report"
4. Keep response SHORT (2-8 words max)
5. If NO format instruction detected, respond with ONLY: None
6. Do NOT include quotation marks or extra explanation

**YOUR RESPONSE** (ONLY the format instruction or "None"):"""

    try:
        messages = [{"role": "user", "content": detection_prompt}]
        response = llm.generate(messages, max_tokens=30, temperature=0.0)

        detected = response.content.strip().strip('"\'').strip('.')

        # Clean up the response
        if detected.lower() == "none" or detected.lower() == "null" or not detected:
            return None

        # Validate it's a reasonable format instruction (not a full sentence)
        if len(detected.split()) > 15:  # Too long, probably not a format instruction
            print(f"[FormatDetector] Detected format too long, ignoring: '{detected}'")
            return None

        print(f"[FormatDetector] ✅ Detected user format: '{detected}'")
        return detected

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[FormatDetector] Error during detection: {e}")
        return None
