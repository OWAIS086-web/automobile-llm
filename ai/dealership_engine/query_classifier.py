"""
Dealership Query Classification

Classifies dealership queries into types:
- AGGREGATION: Count, sum, average queries
- FILTERING: Specific VIN/dealership lookups
- COMPARISON: Compare dealerships/models
- HISTORY: Complete VIN timeline
- SEMANTIC: Text search in descriptions

    classification_prompt = """You are a dealership database query classifier.

Classify this query into ONE of these types:

**1. AGGREGATION** (needs COUNT/SUM/AVG/GROUP BY):
Examples:
- "How many tyre complaints in December?"
- "Which dealership has most warranty claims?"
- "Total PDI inspections by dealership?"
- "Average repair cost by car model?"
- "Show me campaign completion rates"
- "How many H6 vs Jolion complaints?"

**2. FILTERING** (specific record lookup):
Examples:
- "Show warranty claims for VIN ABC123"
- "Which VIN has most complaints?"
- "Show all PDI inspections for Lahore dealership"
- "Get repair orders from last month"
- "Show tyre complaints only"

**3. COMPARISON** (compare entities):
Examples:
- "Compare H6 vs Jolion warranty claims"
- "Lahore vs Karachi dealership performance"
- "Which car model has more complaints - H6 or Jolion?"
- "Compare PDI objection rates across dealerships"

**4. HISTORY** (COMPLETE timeline for VIN - all service types):
**IMPORTANT:** Only use HISTORY if user asks for "complete", "full", "all", or "entire" history/timeline.
If they ask for specific service types (warranty claims, campaigns, PDI), use FILTERING instead.
Examples:
- "Show complete history of VIN XYZ123"
- "Show all service records for this VIN" (all types)
- "VIN history from PDI to latest service" (full timeline)
- "Give me the entire service timeline for this vehicle"

**NOT HISTORY** (these are FILTERING):
- "Has this vehicle had warranty claims?" → FILTERING (specific type)
- "Show campaigns for this VIN" → FILTERING (specific type)
- "Did this car have any warranty claims or campaigns?" → FILTERING (2 specific types)

**5. SEMANTIC** (text search with listing):
Examples:
- "Show complaints about brake noise"
- "Find warranty claims mentioning transmission issues"
- "List all engine problems"
- "Search for electrical complaints"

**6. SEMANTIC_SUMMARY** (natural language overview/summary):
**IMPORTANT:** Use when user wants overview, summary, insights, or "tell me about" (not counts/statistics).
Examples:
- "Tell me about common tyre complaints"
- "Summarize transmission issues"
- "What are the main brake problems?"
- "Give me an overview of warranty claims"
- "Describe typical PDI objections"
- "What kind of electrical issues do we see?"

**NOT SEMANTIC_SUMMARY** (these are AGGREGATION):
- "How many tyre complaints?" → AGGREGATION (wants count)
- "Which has most issues?" → AGGREGATION (wants ranking)
